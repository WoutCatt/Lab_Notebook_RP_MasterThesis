# Lab_Notebook_RP_MasterThesis
This GitHub repository serves as the lab notebook for my research proposal and master's thesis.
In this GitHub repository different files can be found that make up my lab notebook. This includes:
- lab training with multiple tutorials on protein and peptide identification provided by the CompOmics group can be found alongside two Kaggle certificates on the topic of   machine learning and two links to youtube playlists explaining basic mass spectrometry and machine learning concepts.
- Activity report of this first master year.
- Research proposal with both the written version and the powerpoint presentation.
